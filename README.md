PID Temperature Control of a Miniature Thermal Chamber
The PID Temperature Control of a miniature thermal chamber is a system designed for educational purposes. It can be used as an inexpensive lab for developing an understanding of process control and the effects of process dynamics on selecting the optimum PID (proportional, integral, and derivative) tuning constants.
The system can be implemented inexpensively and would be ideal for a student doing an on-line course in process control systems.
The system allows operating, PI, or PID control with reverse or forward (direct) acting control., by using selectable final control elements (resistive heater, or variable fan speed).
The system provides 2 sets of process dynamics by tightly coupling a temperature sensor to the resistive heater or alternatively using a sensor in the centre of the chamber. These very different process dynamics require very different sets of PID tuning.
